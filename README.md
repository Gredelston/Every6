# Every6
Olin College's Class of 2015 was challenged at their commencement by President Miller to find a group of friends who care about your growth, read a non-fiction book every six months (preferably one outside of your area of expertise), write a reflection on it, and submit it to your friends to ensure your continued growth and learning.
Every6 is a platform to facilitate that.
