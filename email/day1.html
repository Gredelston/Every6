<h1>A new term has begun!</h1>

That's right. It's time to pick a new book, and start reading! Remember, you're looking for a <b>non-fiction</b> book, preferably one from <b>outside of your area of expertise</b>.
<br><br>
Everyone should have also posted their reflections from the last term, too. We can't ensure our own growth without an active community providing useful feedback, so <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com/browse">check out what's been happening</a>!
<br><br>
Get started on reading! Six months will catch up with you before you know it.
<br><br>
Best,<br>
