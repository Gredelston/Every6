<h1>The first term has begun!</h1>

That's right, we're hitting the ground running. It's time to pick a book, and start reading! Remember, you're looking for a <b>non-fiction</b> book, preferably one from <b>outside of your area of expertise</b>.
<br><br>
As you know, you will also write a personal reflection on what you've read. This can take any form, but please do reflect. You can submit your reflection <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com/reflect">on our website</a>. You have until November 30.
<br><br>
Get started on reading! Six months will catch up with you before you know it.
<br><br>
Best,<br>
Greg Edelston, under the guise of Every6
