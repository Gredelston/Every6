<h1>We're in the home stretch!</h1>

There are two weeks left in the term. You should be done with your book by now, or at least close. It's time to start reflecting.
<br><br>
Once you've finished your book, submit a reflection <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com/reflect">here</a>. Don't put it off any longer -- this doesn't have to take a long time. Your reflection is critical to your continued growth.
<br><br>
I'm looking forward to reading what you have to say! We have a lot to learn together.
<br><br>
Best,<br>
Greg, under the guise of Every6.
