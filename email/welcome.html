<h1>Welcome to Every6!</h1>

As described by President Richard Miller to the class of 2015, "This is your last homework assignment. It's due every 6 months, and it will be graded when you retire."
<br><br>
This is our study group. We're here to encourage each other to stay on-track, and to provide helpful feedback on our continued growth. As a school full of wise people once sang, "We're all in this together."
<br><br>
Your reflections are due every June 1 and December 1. Of course, you are encouraged to turn in your assignments early. For now, it's time to <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com">get started</a>!
<br><br>
I'm really looking forward to reading with you.
<br><br>
Best,<br>
Greg Edelston, under the guise of Every6
