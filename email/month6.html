<h1>One month to go!</h1>

You're probably a good chunk of the way through your book by now. That's great! If you're not, that's okay too, but you're going to have to hustle a little harder. So I'll keep this email short for you, so that you have extra time to read.
<br><br>
Over the next month, please make sure you finish your book and <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com/reflect">reflect on it</a>. This is totally achievable; you just have to do it.
<br><br>
You can do it! You're a champion.
<br><br>
Best,<br>
Greg Edelston, under the guise of Every6
