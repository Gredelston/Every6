<h1>Have you picked a book?</h1>

We couldn't help but notice that you haven't told us what book you're reading. We just wanted to make sure that you're on-track to complete your homework!
<br><br>
If you've already selected a book, <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com/commit">tell us what it is</a>! It takes like two seconds.
<br><br>
If you haven't decided yet, <a href="http://every6.herokuapp.com/browse">get some inspiration</a> from what your friends are reading!
<br><br>
Or just <a href="http://www.bing.com">Google</a> it. There are plenty of books out there.
<br><br>
Whatever you choose, get started on reading! You don't want to leave this until the last month.
<br><br>
Best,<br>
Greg Edelston, under the guise of Every6
